# Project Simon, what is it?

> "Nan mais ce qui est dingue, c'est, c'est la premi√®re fois que j'en vois une, en vraie, une *Kineuton*!" Simon J√©r√©mi (*La Cit√© de la peur* par Alain Berb√©rian, 1994)

**Simon** is a **DIY open-source motion picture film scanner**, named after Simon J√©r√©mi, the character of Dominique Farrugia in the movie [*La Cit√© de la peur*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/La_Cit%C3%A9_de_la_peur). In this hilarious comedy, Farrugia plays the role of an intellectually disabled star who always wanted to be a projectionist. The project name can stand for _**S**canner d'**I**mages **M**ouvantes d'**O**rigine **N**on-num√©rique_, it can be translated as a moving image scanner of non-digital origin.

Its goal is to bring back to life film stocks, to preserve memories and analog medium nostalgia. It also aims to be easily reproducible, easily upgradeable and affordable.  *Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed!*
